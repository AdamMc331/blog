  Another place for Android wizards to show off their magic, or drown their sorrows. If <a href="http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/15/android">room-15</a> is Jekyll, this place is Hyde. Or maybe the other way around.

This place is *not* [room-15](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/15/android). This place is *not* [SO](http://stackoverflow.com). This place is, let's say, one of the most important and sacred place for Androiders (both developers and enthusiasts).

We haven't decided on a theme yet, so for now, we'll post all kinds of stuff that crosses our mind.

## People
